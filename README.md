# BME680-Python
This repo contains BME680 real-time plotting using Python from Arduino Mega 2560 on Raspberry Pi 4B.

The Arduino code was tested on Arduino IDE 1.8.19

The following screent shot shows the real-time display of Temperature, Pressure, Humidity and Gas Resistance values with respect to time. We didn't plot Altitutde as it is static over time.
